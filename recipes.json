      "content": "I made this for Christmas and my family loved it. I used the baking instructions from the \"Perfect Prime Rib\" article found on this website. I chose to sear the meat then do cook the meat at the low temperature for a long time. It turned out great. Here is the information: Time and Temperature There are two ways you can roast it: At a low temperature for a long time, or At a high temperature for a shorter time. Your roast will shrink less if you cook it low and slow, but you won't get the same flavorful, well-browned exterior that a high roasting temperature gives you. It's possible to combine the two methods by starting the roast at a high temperature to sear the outside of it, then turning down the oven after 30 to 45 minutes to finish the roasting. If roasting at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), the meat will take about 17 to 20 minutes per pound. If you start the roast at 450 degrees F (235 degrees C) for the first 30 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), allow about 13 to 15 minutes per pound. The meat was tender and delicious. Thanks!",

      "content": "Wonderful! Even though I cooked a 4.5 lb roast, I made the amount of garlic mixture called for in the recipe, which covered the fat very generously and produced a delicious crust. One reviewer mentioned their garlic was bitter. I imagine that the high initial temperature of 500 degrees scorched the garlic. I seared my roast at 460 for 12 minutes, and then since the fat seemed like it was on the verge of smoking, I turned the oven down to 400 for the last 8 minutes. I then roasted at 350 degrees rather than the 325 in the recipe, until my meat thermometer read 130 degrees. It was juicy with beautiful pink color in the center. Thanks Chen!",

I didn't have fresh shrimp..had 2 12oz bags of frozen so thawed them first and drained off all the water; proceeded with the recipe as stated. I used just a shy tbsp. of the dijon and on the advice of others, only used 1/2 cup butter. When I got the mixture together, I didn't think there would be enough but continued to heed the repetative advice of other reviewers and stuck with half cup...am glad I did...it was plenty enough and hubby dipped his french bread in the garlic butter! I used 2 cloves of garlic and rough chopped a handful of parsley. I also added a splash of dry white wine...this was fabulous and will definitely make again..don't be shy to try it with the frozen shrimp...just dethaw first and drain off all the water. I served this over linguine.",

My boyfriend and co. devoured this last night at dinner, along with Baked Pineapple and Cheese Vegetable Soup as a starter course (see reviews). In agreement with another reviewer, I found the amount of butter excessive and cut it down to only a little over half. I also doubled the fresh parsley, tripled the garlic (as per usual:-), used bottled lemon juice (since it was all i had on hand and the lemons at the market looked HORRID...gotta love MT produce eh???) and sprinkled the shrimp with old bay, s&p before buttering them. **My shrimp were quite large, and were done in 7-8 minutes....DEFINATELY keep an eye on them, as they tend to get tough, rubbery, and dry when cooked too long. Awesome!!",
