It was a total hit here and my mom told me that it was the best thing I'd ever cooked, & she wants me to make it often now. The only changes I made: I added an extra tablespoon of ground cashews, and also I added the curry at the beginning and cooked it with the onion to bring out more of the spicy taste (I was told this is how traditional Indian cooking is done). All in all this was a simply delicious meal and it tasted exactly like something I would expect to find in an Indian restaurant. The ingredients are simple yet the taste is extremely flavorful and just a tad sweet. The only negative thing I have to say is, the ten minutes the recipe gives you to cook the potatoes is simply ridiculous. I had to leave them for about half-an-hour and even then they were very firm (but not raw). Also, make sure you stir a lot because the stuff tends to stick a little to the bottom at first. Next time (I'm going to make this often!), I'll cook the potatoes a little before-hand, and I'll also add cauliflower.",

I added about 4 cardamon pods, 1 tsp cumin, upped the curry to 2tbs instead of the 1.5tbs, and added a few sprinkles of cinammon. Also, doubled the garlic amount. Didn't use the bell peppers, instead used cauliflower and added fish. So yummy but even better next day. Seriously as good as restaraunt if not better....",
