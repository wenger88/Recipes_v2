We prefer tzaziki sauce, tomatoes, onion and a bit of lettuce if you like. It's also really good if you charcoal a whole chicken (or buy one from Costco!) and strip the meat - dark and white from the chicken and use it for the gyros. We called these Chicken Souvlaki in Australia. Try serving with Tabouli salad and hummus on the side for a nice summer meal!",

In general, the addition of tahini all over the Middle East gives that final extra kick to the otherwise rather bland taste of grilled gyros. Also, lamb gyros is much more fragrant and robust than chicken one, so its even more important for the chicken one to have a right condiment.",
