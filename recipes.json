My 2 and 4 year-olds love it and eat more shrimp than their parents! It is also a big hit with company, and easy to prepare. I make this with frozen or fresh shrimp and use my indoor electric grill if the weather is not good for outside grilling. Try it with a salad, baked potato, and garlic bread.

I chose to sear the meat then do cook the meat at the low temperature for a long time. It turned out great. Here is the information: Time and Temperature There are two ways you can roast it: At a low temperature for a long time, or At a high temperature for a shorter time. Your roast will shrink less if you cook it low and slow, but you won't get the same flavorful, well-browned exterior that a high roasting temperature gives you. It's possible to combine the two methods by starting the roast at a high temperature to sear the outside of it, then turning down the oven after 30 to 45 minutes to finish the roasting. If roasting at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), the meat will take about 17 to 20 minutes per pound. If you start the roast at 450 degrees F (235 degrees C) for the first 30 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), allow about 13 to 15 minutes per pound. The meat was tender and delicious. Thanks!",

One reviewer mentioned their garlic was bitter. I imagine that the high initial temperature of 500 degrees scorched the garlic. I seared my roast at 460 for 12 minutes, and then since the fat seemed like it was on the verge of smoking, I turned the oven down to 400 for the last 8 minutes. I then roasted at 350 degrees rather than the 325 in the recipe, until my meat thermometer read 130 degrees. It was juicy with beautiful pink color in the center. Thanks Chen!",

I used just a shy tbsp. of the dijon and on the advice of others, only used 1/2 cup butter. When I got the mixture together, I didn't think there would be enough but continued to heed the repetative advice of other reviewers and stuck with half cup...am glad I did...it was plenty enough and hubby dipped his french bread in the garlic butter! I used 2 cloves of garlic and rough chopped a handful of parsley. I also added a splash of dry white wine...this was fabulous and will definitely make again..don't be shy to try it with the frozen shrimp...just dethaw first and drain off all the water.

This helps balance the flavor and seems more authentic to the dish – I think.\n 2.)\tAlso, do watch the cooking time.

Turned out perfect but a bit spicy for my taste. My second batch was double. Again I left out the salt (per reviewers' suggestions) and halved the cayenne. Deliciously met my Indian food requirements. My suggestions to you all: 1. Leave out the salt altogether 2. The recipe as written is pretty spicy. Make it the first time as written (minus the salt), but if the spiciness is more/less what you want than modify it the next time. 3. Please don't diss this recipe without trying a few modifications of your own. This is the first chicken tikka masala recipe I ever tried. It turned out wonderfully, but it was way too spicy in the beginning and I listened to the salt warnings, so I modified it slightly. This is the only recipe I will ever use for this meal. !!!!! :-)",

Place the marinated chicken on the rack and broil on high (@ 5 min. each side) I also used thigh instead of breast meat & used olive oil instead of butter to saute the garlic & jalepeno.

      "content": "Familiar with Chinese cooking, I recognized this as a classic blend of seasonings and ingredients as well as an accurate cooking method. Therefore, I prepared this exactly as written - and it was perfect, just as I had anticipated it would be. My only criticism, and the only thing I did differently, was that the recipe calls for round steak, which I don't think is suited for this style of cooking. I used a New York strip steak, but tenderloin or sirloin would have worked well too. The ingredients in the marinade are so traditional and so key to the dish that I don't really see how you could make any changes and get a fair result. This was just delicious and made hubs and I members of \"the clean plate club.\" Just a tip - if you partially freeze the steak for a half hour or so until semi-firm you will find this so much easier to cut into the thin slice so necessary for this style of cooking.",

Before preparing the recipe, rinse the beef off twice and dry on paper towels. Other than that difference, I followed the recipe to a T. Next time might add a few dried chilies, because I like the heat, but the sauce is wonderful!",

If you put the salt on too early it will dry the fish out by drawing out the moisture. Second, I used only a pinch of salt on each side so maybe even a little less than what this calls for but its all about personal taste. Lastly I added a few splashes of white wine when I put the steaks in the pan. It not only adds a nice flavor to the fish but if you then take out the fish and add a little more wine while the pan is really hot it will deglaze your pan and leave you with a really nice white wine and peppercorn reduction (or pan gravy however you wanna call it) for your fish.",
